# PIRATE TEXT ADVENTURE GAME 

## Overview
-This is a simple text-based adventure game where you, a pirate, are on a quest to avenge your fallen crew. To succeed, you must explore various islands, collect important items, and face the fierce Kraken in a final battle. Be wary thoughâ€”if you're not fully prepared, you may not survive the encounter!

## Objective

Your objective is to explore all the islands, collect six key items, and ultimately defeat the Kraken. Along the way, you will navigate between islands and gather the following items:
-Grenado
-Eyepatch
-Pirate Hat
-Cutlass
-Axe
-Pistol
-To win the game, you need to collect all six items before reaching the Kraken's Lair.

## How to Play
**Move Between Islands:**
Use directional commands to move between the islands. Example commands include:
-go north
-go south
-go east
-go west

**Collect Items:**

When you enter a room with an item, you'll receive a message about its presence. You can collect it by typing:
get itemname
For example, if you see a "Cutlass" nearby, you would type get Cutlass to add it to your inventory.

**Fight the Kraken:**

Once you've collected all six items, venture to "Kraken's Lair" to face the Kraken. If you don't have all the items, the Kraken will defeat you.
If you do have all six items, you will successfully defeat the Kraken and win the game.
Exit the Game:

At any point, you can exit the game by typing exit.
